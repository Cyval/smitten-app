# Smitten App

#### This project will deliver a complete package of a cross-platform app for both Android/iOS devices.

### App Features
The app will let users link their Social Media account to find potential friends or partners by browsing nearby users and choosing either to Like or Dislike that person. Matched users can start messaging each other, send voice clips and send meetup requests

Users may fill in their profile details and upload pictures they wish to show on their profile. They can also change their filter or preferences of which kind of persons they would like to see.

Meet up request can be sent to those whom the user have Liked, and on the other hand, the requested user may choose to accept or decline the request, or save it for later. A list of Meet up requests can be browsed by the user.

Users may also choose to watch Live videos and start one as well. A list of Live videos will appear on a userâ€™s live page list if there are people started a live video.

The app has notifications built in, which will be activated when there are Check Ins, Likes, Messages or Meets.
